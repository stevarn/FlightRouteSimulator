Flight Route Simulator 1.0
================================

Experimentation with the Laminar API. 
Here, I have set up a database that calls a list of flights from a specific carrier. The data is the parsed into the database*. Each subsequent call also records any aircraft's position, so that you can plot a flight path from the data. 

*Saving data from the Laminar Data API is a breach of the <a href="https://developer.laminardata.aero/admin/account/termsofservice/">Laminar Data API TOS 4.5.1</a>. This code was written and made publicly available for educational purposes only.
