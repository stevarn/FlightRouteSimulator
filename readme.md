Flight Route Simulator 1.0
================================

Experimentation with the Laminar API. 
Here, I have set up a database that calls a list of flights from a specific carrier. The data is the parsed into the database*. Each subsequent call also records any aircraft's position, so that you can plot a flight path from the data.
